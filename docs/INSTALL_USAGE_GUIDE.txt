----------------------------------

1) R E Q U I R E M E N T S

----------------------------------

- Supported Linux server distributation:
	- Debian / Ubuntu
	- RedHat / CentOS
- root access on Linux server
- Installed TeamSpeak 3 server
- Some needed software packages:
	- rsync
	- mktemp
	- wget
	- grep
	- telnet (optional; if you want to inform online clients about server update)
	- sed
	- unzip
	- mail (for cronjob, if you want to receive the output as E-Mail)


----------------------------------

2) I N S T A L L A T I O N

----------------------------------

a) Download the TS3 UpdateScript from addons.teamspeak.com: http://addons.teamspeak.com/directory/tools/miscellaneous/Script-Automated-TeamSpeak-3-update-with-version-checker.html

b) Unzip the downloaded 'TS3UpdateScript_vX.Y.zip' archive on your Linux server:
	unzip TS3UpdateScript_vX.Y.zip

   HINT: X.Y means the version. The archive can for example look like following: TS3UpdateScript_v1.7.zip
         You can unzip and use the script from each directory of your server which you want to.

c) Make the script executable:
	chmod +x TS3UpdateScript.sh

d) Run the script once, to detect all TeamSpeak 3 server instances, that the script can copy the 'password-file' file to each directory:
	./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check

	HINT: If a newer TeamSpeak 3 server version is available, enter "n" to stop the script.

e) If you want to inform online clients about coming server updates with your own text and displayed username, you have to edit the following files:
	- auto_update_text.txt
		This file/text will be used, if the cronjob executes the script. The server informs your online clients and will wait 5 minutes before it starts the update process.

	- update_text.txt
		This file/text will be used, if you are executing the script manually. The update process starts, if you hit "yes".

	- displayed_user_name.txt
		This file contains the username, which will be displayed for poke messages

	- ignore_clients.txt
		This file contains client_database_id's of users, which should not get any poke messages about updates
		HINT: Do NOT remove the number 1 from this file!

	- password-file
		This file contains the 'serveradmin' password to connect to your server
		HINT: The password-file is located in each TeamSpeak 3 server root directory

	HINT: Both texts has a limitation of 100 characters. The script checks at the start, if you are using a valid length. After editing the file(s), you should run the script once manually to check and see, if the length is ok: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check --inform-online-clients password-file

f) Finish! Read the USAGE below to see, how you can use it



----------------------------------

3) U S A G E

----------------------------------

HINT: The script needs root permissions, because it's detecting all informations automatical and it's also using some commands, which are just available with root permissions.

a) Simply start the script with following syntax:
	./TS3UpdateScript.sh OPTION(S)

b) The script has an included "help"-page:
	./TS3UpdateScript.sh --help
	or
	./TS3UpdateScript.sh -h



----------------------------------

4. U P D A T E   T E X T   E X A M P L E S

----------------------------------

Following you can see some examples, how you can fill your 'auto_update_text.txt' and 'update_text.txt' files:

a) This server will be updated to version $VERSION in 5 minutes. Please wait...

b) Server update to version $VERSION in 5 minutes.

c) The server will restart for server update. New version $VERSION will be installed.

d) The server will be updated. Please wait a while...

e) An update will be executed. Please try to reconnect in a few seconds...



----------------------------------

5) U S A G E   E X A M P L E S

----------------------------------

Following you can see some examples how you can use the script. A line started with "#" is just a comment...

# Easy check; Just check, if a newer TeamSpeak 3 server version is available. If yes it asks you, if you want to update it
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check

# Check with deleting logs; Same as above, but if it updates your server, it also will delete your old server logs
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check --delete-old-logs

# Easy check with informing online clients; Checks if a newer version is available and informs online clients about a update process, if you are updating the server (password-file must include your 'serveradmin' password); informing will just work, if the serveradmin password is correct
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check --inform-online-clients

# Check with deleting logs and informing online clients; Same as above, but also deletes old logs (password-file must include your 'serveradmin' password)
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check --delete-old-logs --inform-online-clients

# Check with deleting logs and informing online clients; Same as above, but works just with the given directory
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --check --delete-old-logs --inform-online-clients --path /path/to/teamspeak_server/

# Installs weekly check cronjob for monday at 3 AM
# Same as './TS3UpdateScript.sh --check', but it's automated - you don't have to enter yes or no. Default is 'yes'
# Don't forget to provide your E-Mail address in the following file: administrator_eMail.txt
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --autoupdate yes --check

# Same as above, but it will also delete old logs
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --autoupdate yes --check --delete-old-logs

# Installs weekly check cronjob for monday at 3 AM; it also informs online clients and will wait 5 minutes for updating (password-file must include your 'serveradmin' password)
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --autoupdate yes --check --inform-online-clients

# Installs weekly check cronjob for monday at 3 AM; it also deletes old logs, informs online clients and will wait 5 minutes for updating (password-file must include your 'serveradmin' password)
# This is my (Sebastian Kraetzig) personal favourite :)
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --autoupdate yes --check --delete-old-logs --inform-online-clients

# Deinstalls weekly cronjob of monday at 3 AM
Command: ./TS3UpdateScript.sh --autoupdate no

HINT: If you are installing a cronjob, it will look like following:
	0 3 * * 0  root /path/to/TS3UpdateScript.sh --path /home/to/teamspeak/install_dir --cronjob-auto-update --check --delete-old-logs --inform-online-clients

	The "TS3 UpdateScript" cronjob can be found here: /etc/cron.d/TS3UpdateScript



----------------------------------

6) H O W - T O   G E T   "client_database_id"

----------------------------------

1. Open a telnet connection to your TeamSpeak 3 server on the ServerQuery Port (default: 10011)

2. Login wih your ServerQuery account:
	login serveradmin very$SecretPassword2014

3. Connect to your virtual server if needed:
	use sid=1
	or
	use port=9987

4. Fetch the clientlist of your virtual server:
	clientlist

5. Copy & Paste the whole output of "clientlist" in your editor/notepad and search with "Strg/Ctrl" and "F" the clients nickname, which client_database_id you need/want
	You will find something like this:
	clid=5 cid=2034 client_database_id=1243 client_nickname=Sebbo client_type=0

	HINT: Each clientinfo is between two pipes (|)!

6. Save the client_database_id in the file 'ignore_clients.txt' in a extra line to ignore that client for update pokes
	Here for example: 1243


----------------------------------

7. D E B B U G I N G

----------------------------------

You will not need to debug and fix the issue by yourself. Just activate something from the script and send me the output of the script via eMail to mail@ts3-tools.info.

1. Open the 'TS3UpdateScript.sh' with an text editor such as nano, vim or notepad

2. In line 5 you should find following code:
	#set -x

3. Remove the hashtag from the line. Now it should look like following:
	set -x

4. Save the file and close it

5. Execute the script with those parameters you want and copy and paste the output into an eMail

6. Send me the ouput via eMail
